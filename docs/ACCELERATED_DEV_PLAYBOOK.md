# üöÄ Accelerated Development Playbook
*Based on Stakeholder Insights & AI Agent Best Practices*

## The 10x Productivity Formula

### Core Principle: Documentation ‚Üí Tickets ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Batch Testing
As discovered by Person 1 through extensive AI-assisted development, this workflow enables 10-20 hour productive workdays without fatigue.

## üß† Cognitive Offloading Strategy

### What to Delegate to AI
```python
AI_TASKS = {
    "automatic": [
        "Documentation generation",
        "Test case creation", 
        "Code review first pass",
        "Ticket prioritization",
        "Dependency tracking"
    ],
    "semi_automatic": [
        "Architecture decisions",
        "Performance optimization",
        "Security review"
    ],
    "human_only": [
        "Business logic validation",
        "User experience decisions", 
        "Final deployment approval"
    ]
}
```

## üìù Documentation-First Development

### Why It Works Now (2025)
- **AI can finally read and understand documentation**
- **Projects become self-maintaining** - "The project itself knows how to maintain itself"
- **Knowledge retention** - No dependency on individual developers
- **Enables true handoffs** - Can migrate entire codebases between teams/tools

### Implementation
1. **Write project plan BEFORE coding**
2. **Update documentation WITH every code change**
3. **Use AI to verify doc-code synchronization**
4. **Generate test data FROM documentation**

## üîß The Anti-Pattern: Don't Test Too Early

### Traditional Approach (SLOW)
```
Write Code ‚Üí Write Tests ‚Üí Refactor ‚Üí Update Tests ‚Üí Repeat
```

### Accelerated Approach (FAST)
```
Experiment ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Stabilize Architecture ‚Üí Write Tests Once
```

### When to Write Tests
- **TOO EARLY:** During rapid prototyping
- **TOO EARLY:** When architecture is changing daily
- **RIGHT TIME:** After core patterns emerge
- **RIGHT TIME:** When preparing for production
- **RIGHT TIME:** At end of development cycle

## ü§ñ AI Agent Configuration

### Optimal Tool Stack (Jan 2025)
```yaml
development:
  ide: "Cursor with GPT-4/Claude"
  documentation: "AI generates from code"
  testing: "pytest + AI test generation"
  deployment: "GitHub Actions + AI review"

ai_agents:
  primary: "Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex logic"
  secondary: "GPT-4 for documentation"
  specialized: "Local LLMs for repetitive tasks"
```

### Workflow Automation
```python
# Actual workflow from stakeholder experience
WORKFLOW = {
    "1_document": "AI creates comprehensive docs",
    "2_tickets": "AI generates detailed todo items",
    "3_implement": "Human selects, AI assists",
    "4_review": "AI checks consistency",
    "5_test": "Batch testing at milestone",
    "6_deploy": "Automated with AI verification"
}
```

## üìä Immediate Focus Areas

### Week 1: Agro-Robotics Module
Based on stakeholder conviction about agro-robotics opportunity:

```python
AGRO_ROBOTICS_TRACKER = {
    "companies": [
        "Deere & Co (DE)",
        "AGCO Corp (AGCO)", 
        "Kubota (KUBTY)",
        "CNH Industrial (CNHI)"
    ],
    "etfs": [
        "ROBO Global Robotics (ROBO)",
        "Global X Robotics & AI (BOTZ)"
    ],
    "ukraine_exposure": [
        "Companies with Ukraine operations",
        "EU ag-tech funds",
        "FAO investment recipients"
    ]
}
```

### Week 2: Regulatory Signal Tracking
Person 1's insight: "Regulations create predictable catalysts"

```python
REGULATORY_TRACKER = {
    "immediate": [
        "EU sustainability mandates",
        "US infrastructure spending",
        "China tech regulations"
    ],
    "monitoring": [
        "Hemp/cotton subsidies",
        "Autonomous vehicle laws",
        "Agricultural robot standards"
    ]
}
```

## üéØ The "Spaghetti Strategy"

Quote: "Throw a lot of spaghetti, some will stick"

### Implementation
1. **Build multiple small features quickly**
2. **Test with real users immediately**
3. **Double down on what works**
4. **Kill what doesn't within 1 week**

### Current Spaghetti to Throw
- [ ] Agro-robotics screener
- [ ] Ukraine opportunity tracker
- [ ] Regulatory calendar alerts
- [ ] "Copy the rich" module
- [ ] Supply chain mapper
- [ ] Short-term momentum signals

## üí° Critical Insights

### From Person 1's Experience

1. **"Projects that took years are now done in months"**
   - AI acceleration is real and measurable
   - 10x productivity gains are achievable

2. **"You're not getting tired working 20 hours"**
   - Cognitive offloading to AI prevents burnout
   - Focus on decision-making, not implementation

3. **"The code don't look too hard at it, it works"**
   - Perfect is the enemy of shipped
   - Documentation matters more than pretty code

4. **"Wait for the market to collapse"**
   - Build during quiet periods
   - Be ready when opportunity arrives

## üìà Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Target:** 5 features per week
- **Current:** 1-2 features per week
- **Gap:** Implement AI agents fully

### Code Quality
- **Target:** 50% test coverage (‚úÖ Achieved)
- **Target:** <24hr bug fix time
- **Target:** 0 critical security issues

### Business Impact
- **Target:** 10 beta users by Feb 2025
- **Target:** 1 profitable trade signal by Mar 2025
- **Target:** $10K AUM by Q2 2025

## üö® Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### What NOT to Do
1. **Don't over-engineer early** - MVP first, optimize later
2. **Don't write tests during prototyping** - Waste of time
3. **Don't ignore documentation** - It's your AI's memory
4. **Don't build trading execution yet** - Information first
5. **Don't chase perfection** - Ship and iterate

### What TO Do Instead
1. **Ship daily** - Small increments
2. **Document everything** - AI needs context
3. **Batch operations** - Test/deploy in groups
4. **Follow the money** - Track what rich investors do
5. **Exploit catalysts** - Regulatory changes = alpha
