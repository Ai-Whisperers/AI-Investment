##  Testing Strategy (End of Week ONLY!)
Following the "Don't Test Too Early" principle:

### What NOT to Test Yet
- Architecture that's still changing
- Experimental features
- UI/UX iterations
- Performance optimizations

### What to Test (Batch at Week End)
- [ ] Critical signal detection logic
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Payment processing (when added)
- [ ] Data integrity checks

##  Remember the Principles

1. **"Throw spaghetti at the wall"** - Build 10 features, keep 3
2. **"Don't test too early"** - Tests slow down rapid iteration
3. **"Documentation enables AI"** - Keep docs updated for AI assistance
4. **"Cognitive offloading"** - Let AI handle boilerplate
5. **"6-48 hour advantage"** - Speed is our edge

##  Current Sprint Focus (Do These First!)

### TODAY:
1. Connect TwelveData API (2 hours)
2. Connect MarketAux API (1 hour)
3. Test real signal generation (1 hour)

### TOMORROW:
1. WebSocket backend (2 hours)
2. WebSocket frontend (2 hours)
3. Deploy to Render.com (1 hour)

### THIS WEEK:
1. Portfolio management (4 hours)
2. Backtesting framework (4 hours)
3. Alert system (2 hours)
4. BATCH TEST everything (2 hours)

##  Notes

- **Priority**: Items marked  are blocking production use
- **Time estimates**: Based on "throw spaghetti" approach (build fast, refine later)
- **Dependencies**: Real data APIs must work before other features matter
- **Testing**: Only test at week end, not during development
- **Documentation**: Update as we build for AI comprehension
