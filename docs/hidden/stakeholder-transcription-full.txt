I was taking a look on because I expect a lot of breakthrough in in the robotics and specific agro robotics and I've been looking on places to invest and they are not really there there are some that have like closed uh yeah how do you say share offerings but then you're talking one share share is that like a hundred thousand dollars or more so yeah no uh then you have like publicly traded uh funds that are investing in agro Tech uh but I there were like two of them I found but I had I couldn't find where I could invest in that one I was just still looking for it I mean if you find it let me know um but I I think it was an Italian one but but it recently opened also the same front in in the on another stock exchange I mean did they have multiple stock exchange but what they do they invest in the agro tech yes in the in the advanced tech but not really from hey robotics because you're going to get with AI uh the the the the life increase the lack of uh of youngsters working uh that want to work that want to work in agriculture it's going to go less and less and it's the place easiest to automate not easy to do but it's at this moment uh able to automate so you're going to get a lot of technology there and specifically to watch Ukraine which is already a very agricultural sector which now does a lot of robotics for some some kind of reasons there will be a lot of uh of of if there are funds in Ukraine at some moment that go in that one in the agricultural uh robotics that's where you should invest in but it's like hey look at this take a take a look at it if you have funds from hey this and this one could be invested in but uh I'm actually still waiting for the market to collapse what is what is what

Like the platform, you can work out how can you be a helpful investor AI, how can you help people. But in reality it's not to be a platform to buy or sell stocks, it's more a platform to get information about the stocks. Yeah, but it also is, it will be later that also, but initially just to get information and to help you decide which ones to buy, why to buy them. But also, if you think this is a service online, this is also from, hey, we can teach you how to really leverage AI in research, and this is our talent. How you say, this service, yeah, how you say, we put the brakes here, we put the service here, but yeah, we need to meet also. If you find this one valuable, you know, hey, leave something also. Yeah. But for now, we are like, let's see what happens, let's ask about money. Yeah. The thing is, is make a, make a, I would say throw a lot of spaghetti at some moment, some will stick. Yeah. And this one, we want to make it really nice, beautiful. Yeah, as a, as a presentation. Yeah. So when you are talking to Gaston, you can be like, hey, they made this. Yeah. Instead of, I have no idea. Just ask me the link, I will, if you have one already. Not yet. I don't think it's too presentable, because it still needs to have more of. Yeah. The data analysis and gathering of information. But once you have one, pass me, I will pass it to you. Yeah. But I, I, I was telling him already what you were doing a little bit, so he, he probably will check it out. Okay. Like the idea is to gather lots of fish from different spots, like all of the standards, those information where they are, what the CEO is, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Also try to get. My son, may you be well. Yes. May the light protect you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

How do you say? You can really target, follow people. It's not spying, because everything is public, and a lot of people will try to keep a low public profile, but a lot of those makers and shakers, they do have, how do you say, an exposed profile. They want to make their realities. It's also sometimes, this is, why are they people doing that? Why are they pushing this? Who is pushing that one? How do you say, for example, Musk, he plays a lot of, how do you say, he does a lot of industry, whatever, but behind the scenes, he's doing a lot of politics, and a lot of dirty politics, and what so ever. And being aware in which way he's doing it. In which group they are all involved in, what those groups are busy with. All the, how do you say, what is the agenda that they are pushing, and why are they pushing that agenda? Is it, how do you say, they're all, they always say, those multi-millionaires, they are always talking for the best for humanity, and what so ever. But somehow, the best for humanity is always aligning very good with their, how do you say? The wallet. So, what you need to take a look on, what are those people doing? Because they are, they are also creating opportunities. They are not just using opportunities, they are making them. And especially those, in the chart, those investment funds ones, Sam Altman used to be one of them. And I'm still seeing him on the good side. Until proven otherwise. A lot of other ones, they are, how do you say, burned by too much money and capital, and what so ever. I'm going to my room, let me know in the beginning.

He sees the change of society coming and you have more on the AI field. That where you have also the in the AI field you have two beliefs more or less. One is the AI doom more or less from we need to slow it down too dangerous blah blah and the other one is everything is fucked up anyway and let AI help us out a little bit. People lie, steal, are corrupt, are horrible, politicians lie. Bitch please why would the AI steal? What portal would it need? More electricity? It doesn't need humanity. How do you say that is you know the comparable principle you know you're always the center of it and it's like oh we're so important. No you don't care in principle the AI world do its AI thing it's the same like yeah the earth will be around you know we'll keep spinning around the sun humanity has nothing to do with that one would be nice if we can survive you know and not fuck up everything. I think we will. But yeah for now my idea is to try to find any possible insider trading any other information of where the news are going all the sectors of each companies are growing the supply chain. The thing is regarding insider trading is what Trump is doing in America but the thing is he's all that's all short-term investment but the thing is he gives signals to people to buy and sell or whatsoever by you know having a different hat on or whatsoever. You have no clue which signals to look for but the one that know ah okay shares in this one. From this more like well you've got a lot of money, the US is spending so many things randomly on this specific sector over there. There will be a bunch of companies there that will be growing. The thing is what you need to do is to run this scenario through how do you say explain the whole scenario to AI what currently is going on this is the terms that are put up. Yeah we also want to include legal stuff and regulations that that countries are doing for example like the USB-C type. Sorry the US? No Apple stuff doesn't have their own proprietary cable anymore they have to use the yeah yeah the Europe forces that one on those companies yes because companies want people to lock in Europe what what is best for the consumer in Europe you have uh where the consumer the the producer and the the the employee so capital uh work and consumer they work together together with the environment and government it's it's what there's a specific type of work, for that one where where you have a democracy where all the factors of society are working together not not fighting against each other you have that sometimes in France and whatsoever and in England or whatever but you seldom see uh the strikes in in in in Holland, Belgium, well Belgium sometimes and in Sweden and Norway almost never because that you know the the arranged thing is very expensive to strike and whatsoever you know arrange those things I mean don't be an you know and the thing is is in French they are very arrogant and whatsoever especially you know the people in in government or if I say they're in in companies or whatever and and that's why there's a lot more conflict between the the workers and and the rich people well oh yeah try to see what other people that have lots of money are doing try to copy them kind of copy them but like make all of them what you're doing available when you are looking for a stock so know what else is happening also know about the supply chain there was one where I think there was the the the the the the one not from from IBM or the the no sorry not IBM who googled the one of the owners or the the brain or search brain I think he he's not owner anymore because he's doing a lot of AI stuff or whatever and he was still talking it was like for students was that one from Harvard or whatever he was talking you know how he was seeing everything on things developing which this was like half a year ago so it's kind of still spot on and he's like yeah this field will develop and we have investments in this one and we have investments in this one so the day he was explaining exactly all the fields that were how do you say at that moment you are starting to pop up to pop up and they have maybe half a year of head start on them but things are going so fast that the half a year is over before you know it and uh this moment you space that is how you say is gonna get booming very soon and it's probably not SpaceX like for example now we're not even thinking of which companies you look at yeah we just want to look at every company yeah yeah and we want to know what information about these companies would you would be nice for you to know the thing is what you're going to get now is how do you say you have now an AI revolution is going on yeah that will have a complete ripple effect through whole society that god knows what was what what effects is going to happen but a lot of effects you're going to get the car industry is going to completely change because the the you get self-driving cars people are using cars and services and because now you can do that now all those things are possible so right whole transportation is going to go gonna change projects that took years to to to to get done are now done in a month a half a year because completely how do you say the the self-driving buses that auto go together and whatsoever and there is no burst later whatsoever it automatically arranges I know that things will explode because the air will explode and you'll make other things more efficient but like let's say you're like when we have filters so you can just look at stocks for example the sector of AI or yeah yeah no no but how do you what what how do you say what a lot of things are going to happen in a month a half a year because you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that

yeah on one side because of the whole ai and whatever a lot of possession value all those things that's going to be completely twisted i don't know what will have value in 20 years although there's always a time where you convert one something to another thing to another thing so you will end up still having something or whatever and worst case everything is better for everybody so yay uh now if you then have long-term investments it's long-term investment for what for later on when my money doesn't care anymore it's like long term is longer than like one month yeah yeah but long-term investment you're normally counting like five five years i i still still you do need to do long-term investment depending on the company companies definitely but if you find some that are like okay ish this one will explode quickly and nice cash for going to holland why not now the thing is if you have the technology and everything because on the on when you do long-term investments the long-term investment they go always um um um I don't know um yeah otherwise so if you have a long-term investment you're actually making only a very limited amount on that long-term investment with the technology that you have so you rather have your technology invested in in very short-term term gains where you can have a sure win but anyway that is once it's really nice for long-term we will definitely go into short-term also I didn't let me guess another filter for the thing to do but my friend would really be interested in that he was also more interested in those short-term ones yeah but uh how do you say you need always to play uh how you say you dry play for a long time and fine-tune your mechanics and then you never take uh uh uh you know you uh how do you say position that you can you cannot uh yeah you need to change what information would help you decide if yes to invest in a stock or not for me yeah uh for for me it's more the the long-term impact from the stock itself is it something I want to invest in a stock or not for me yeah uh for for me it's more the long-term impact from the stock itself is it something I want to invest in a stock or not for me yeah uh for

with an extension and integrated with what you're making that's all up to you yeah but like those are familiar things like for after the yeah yeah how do you say you have you start with something and then oh but then we can do this and then we can do that then you know you pivot and you and then first i just want to think about how to make the mvp better yeah and then stress about all of the yeah how to sell how to make money yeah because it will make money because it's like it's a investment exactly but they're like any like because for now is we're mainly focusing on focusing on getting fits of different types of news and for for now you should just experiment and then uh did you know and making an experiment that makes money at some moment even better what it is from yeah this is this experiment experiment experience of fine tuning your home your skills uh how do you say it's everything is a learning process and at some moment you should try to to hear how to say to how to say to find the right balance in spawning of all the projects and the the the feedback loop of your your your workflow to improve that one and uh and yeah and finishing up with projects and new projects and somehow you get so many new things yeah i'm still talking to the eyes to make the documentation i'm still working on the same time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how do you say i want to go to continue with what i was doing uh how do you say you have ages that just go through the to-do list one by one by one or so uh first i make a documentation of all of the current code that kirian made yeah from my initial version yeah from the documentation i'm telling i'm also asking it make a to-do for things to improve an app and it makes a detail to do for everything in a separate folder yeah uh yeah yeah you just use a folder system uh for it yeah and then you select yourself which one uh which one to go where to do you go through then you first set up your documentation to make sure it's correct and then if you find something you don't like it you tell it update it to be like this yeah then it updates the code then you tell it again fix it between the code and the documentation then you tell it work on this to do it's already read to make sure that everything is okay at the same time i'm telling it make more to do's and then the other one i'm telling it make tests and make sure that the project runs yeah yeah yeah exactly and what i still have is that um my code is is changing and then um uh how do you say i i still need to do afterwards okay it doesn't still compile and auto unit test everything so which should be you know like an automatic step that that you don't want to i think you can add hooks for that where you put just like a prompt that you want to always add at the end where you put just like ultra think remember to add test and verify the run yeah yeah but the thing is is is is i don't need to do it every task but it's from okay are we done okay did you run the uh complete it doesn't need to do that every time it just needs to do it on the end yeah i know but for example those things is what i need to how do you say you need to you need to show me someone with how to do those things because i have no time to go after it how to set it up better blah blah blah i i have how to say now i know a little bit better how to say a little bit of standard coming in that one i will now apply the the like first thing or there's like a little bit of standards uh getting there and i want to apply that one and let's see if if it makes a difference uh in it do i get better output to get more concise results etc because that at this moment is not it could be better and how do you say that there are probably a lot of tips and tricks at this moment for example have you considered just asking cursor hey improve your own rules yeah no no not that step is what i need to go through but i already say i have now also things to do so i have things to do and then when i'm done with those ones i'm going to recycle again through the to the rules to update them of course i always do that with ai is it's the no no but not just the rules i said what else can you add here yeah yeah but what you get then it starts it starts to add a lot of so hey you you you want to have the the the the the right minimal amount to get the right instead of telling it to add tell it make a file to explain all of the things you can i i i'm doing those doing those things it goes like that we set up all of the mcps and the other random things that it just uses to work more efficiently yeah what what i want to do is is what those rules do now that they are that i run like uh how do you call that a standard two call a python call just runs it and the local local llm is set up through the agent if you get what i mean yeah ah but yeah that is how how you how to say what what you need to do i need to set up the my automatic agent still you know for documentation that automatically filter out some of my conversations that extra tool chain that is what i need to add stuff and then it's next step for automation more to the the ticket workflow is correctly done the the the the documentation one is correctly done uh the rules are then will be better there by that time better also ai on that one then let's take a look well then how's the generation of uh functional specifications like to conference diagrams that's if you're gonna use certificate from five for that put it in max with the i i put it now i i put it as the model to use jet 55 but i didn't you know the thing is is i on purpose put like small steps so i uh how to say i there is one conversion from uh c++ code that i want to use what i want to do that planning part that i want to try out the gpd5 in max mode from hey this is the code in c++ make me the plan to migrate this one to c to c sharp another thing is to iterate many times over hey make sure the plan is good and everything is perfect and you don't miss anything ultra thing remember remember remember check my notes and whatsoever yeah but how do you say the the that is the critique that is from okay this is good enough next uh and and that's why i always let it review still from okay all the steps are they are they done are is everything up to date can you verify once once more yes check check check check check so it it runs through the different tickets to different to do's uh yeah and it knows which one are related to each other it does i'm doing there next to each other the principal if you have i don't know you could you could do them all in parallel i think you can now with with course or with the latest updates sorry have multiple shots at the same time i i think you you can but the oh what what is now is you can in a chat you can um not interrupt but you can uh it's like you're talking it's talking to you but you can inter interject or something what would be nice if you can pause it because when you wanted to type you want to type it in the chat you want to type it in the chat you want to react to something that's here and it's blah blah blah blah when you hit enter it's already like three sentences later so uh you you want to have that better alliance but uh it's it's nice that uh that you can interrupt it you can see what it's doing and now it makes also sense to follow what it is doing because if you see it it's like thinking and it's not getting it it was like oh no hey you forget about this one you know and what you want to find is all those places where you needed to interject it because there is where all your specifications was not good or your workflow not good or what's to happen

I was with Gaston talking was you know I was explaining on one side that we we make first the rules and whatsoever and that we had the hackathon that we that I explained everything to and then under a tree and in America you you you put it because that's how they want to say they're gonna plant trees and they put one under it I mean if Eva would do that one Sonia will love it exactly anyway not do something more serious I was explaining is that how do you say that we were working on the ticket rules and that we were working on the ticket rules and that we were working on the ticket rules and that we were we were working on the ticket rules and that we were getting better and better in in the the getting better and better in in the the workflow of the tickets and that I was getting better and better in in the the workflow of the tickets and that I was explained that we workflow of the tickets and that I was explained that we had a hackathon with uh Hugo and on one explained that we had a hackathon with uh Hugo and on one side is what you you notice there is side is what you you notice there is from hey don't make the unit test too early because from hey don't make the unit test too early because you know your code is a lot of changing you know your code is a lot of changing still you don't want to define by unit test you want still you don't want to define by unit test you want to define by projects because there's where to define by projects because there's where you define everything and then I was back on you define everything and then I was back on the time City engine and I had a lot of work to do to the time City engine and I had a lot of work to do to get things done for the to go on vacation and get things done for the to go on vacation and what I did there is uh how do you say there is where I what I did there is uh how do you say there is where I use that that the workflow technique but use that that the workflow technique but I also because I was repeating every time explaining I also because I was repeating every time explaining everything and correcting everything I everything I made that project plan that project plan is so important and that has a many many made that project plan is so important and that has a many many benefits is at one time for example benefits is at one time for example retainment if you have your project plan not correct retainment if you have your project plan not correct it describes the you're less dependent on it describes the you're less dependent on people staying on the project now there's a many time is people staying on the project now there's a many time is you need to keep the knowledge in the in you need to keep the knowledge in the in the in the air because otherwise you don't know how to the air because otherwise you don't know how to retain it anymore now the project itself knows retain it anymore now the project itself knows how to maintain itself the different mindset already how to maintain itself the different mindset already that's already that opens for a business that's already that opens for a business already so many opportunities from ah finally we can get already so many opportunities from ah finally we can get rid of those people or finally where we rid of those people or finally where we can migrate this stuff away because if you can make the can migrate this stuff away because if you can make the project you can project you can make the project you can uh make it in this other tool yeah exactly make uh make it in this other tool yeah exactly make it in the this this code wall code hey do this it in the this other tool yeah exactly make it in the this this code wall code hey do this now in in the other code you now in in the other code you know those things are coming that uh that is coming that will be know those things are coming that uh that is coming that will be happening for eBay scripting and happening for eBay scripting and everything will that will happen anyway now um what happened there because you're describing the project you get much clearer on the project I mean in the past you were never doing that one because you were doing that for nobody because nobody was reading the documentation was reading the documentation but now finally an AI is doing that one finally anyway so it makes sense to make that one and it is a very easy also to make it nowadays so it's almost no effort but it's a high high gain uh you get everything sharper you can get also inconsistencies in your project so a lot of things are from that little step a lot of automatic things that are following again it's like self-improving it's the whole cycle the whole factory starts improving now when I was working with AI doing those things making those last final changes I have to say we by the way I got like insights that I never had in the original code that we we wrote it was from hey the code don't look too hard to it it works uh but don't change don't change anything blah blah you you know just a moment still and um um how do you say but now the definitions are actually very clear now there are like okay why we can do some things in certain places something's not etc etc and that is only possible because you have now clear documentation but I can now also automatically from hey based on this documentation what would be my test data you know you can run uh easily simulate uh data yeah watch out with um but the thing is is you're busy with it you're working more than 10 hours a day uh close to 20 or whatsoever and you're not getting tired and that was from hey not getting tired you're you're you're you're offloading you're you're you're you're cognitive offloading a lot of of work so you get so much more done so you have more efficient blah blah blah and you're not getting tired you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're

I was taking a look on because I expect a lot of breakthrough in in the robotics and specific agro robotics and I've been looking on places to invest and they are not really there there are some that have like closed uh yeah how do you say share offerings but then you're talking one share share is that like a hundred thousand dollars or more so yeah no uh then you have like publicly traded uh funds that are investing in agro Tech uh but I there were like two of them I found but I had I couldn't find where I could invest in that one I was just still looking for it I mean if you find it let me know um but I I think it was an Italian one but but it recently opened also the same front in in the on another stock exchange I mean did they have multiple stock exchange but what they do they invest in the agro tech yes in the in the advanced tech but not really from hey robotics because you're going to get with AI uh the the the the life increase the lack of uh of youngsters working uh that want to work that want to work in agriculture it's going to go less and less and it's the place easiest to automate not easy to do but it's at this moment uh able to automate so you're going to get a lot of technology there and specifically to watch Ukraine which is already a very agricultural sector which now does a lot of robotics for some some kind of reasons there will be a lot of uh of of if there are funds in Ukraine at some moment that go in that one in the agricultural uh robotics that's where you should invest in but it's like hey look at this take a take a look at it if you have funds from hey this and this one could be invested in but uh I'm actually still waiting for the market to collapse what is what is what Like the platform, you can work out how can you be a helpful investor AI, how can you help people. But in reality it's not to be a platform to buy or sell stocks, it's more a platform to get information about the stocks. Yeah, but it also is, it will be later that also, but initially just to get information and to help you decide which ones to buy, why to buy them. But also, if you think this is a service online, this is also from, hey, we can teach you how to really leverage AI in research, and this is our talent. How you say, this service, yeah, how you say, we put the brakes here, we put the service here, but yeah, we need to meet also. If you find this one valuable, you know, hey, leave something also. Yeah. But for now, we are like, let's see what happens, let's ask about money. Yeah. The thing is, is make a, make a, I would say throw a lot of spaghetti at some moment, some will stick. Yeah. And this one, we want to make it really nice, beautiful. Yeah, as a, as a presentation. Yeah. So when you are talking to Gaston, you can be like, hey, they made this. Yeah. Instead of, I have no idea. Just ask me the link, I will, if you have one already. Not yet. I don't think it's too presentable, because it still needs to have more of. Yeah. The data analysis and gathering of information. But once you have one, pass me, I will pass it to you. Yeah. But I, I, I was telling him already what you were doing a little bit, so he, he probably will check it out. Okay. Like the idea is to gather lots of fish from different spots, like all of the standards, those information where they are, what the CEO is, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Also try to get. My son, may you be well. Yes. May the light protect you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How do you say? You can really target, follow people. It's not spying, because everything is public, and a lot of people will try to keep a low public profile, but a lot of those makers and shakers, they do have, how do you say, an exposed profile. They want to make their realities. It's also sometimes, this is, why are they people doing that? Why are they pushing this? Who is pushing that one? How do you say, for example, Musk, he plays a lot of, how do you say, he does a lot of industry, whatever, but behind the scenes, he's doing a lot of politics, and a lot of dirty politics, and what so ever. And being aware in which way he's doing it. In which group they are all involved in, what those groups are busy with. All the, how do you say, what is the agenda that they are pushing, and why are they pushing that agenda? Is it, how do you say, they're all, they always say, those multi-millionaires, they are always talking for the best for humanity, and what so ever. But somehow, the best for humanity is always aligning very good with their, how do you say? The wallet. So, what you need to take a look on, what are those people doing? Because they are, they are also creating opportunities. They are not just using opportunities, they are making them. And especially those, in the chart, those investment funds ones, Sam Altman used to be one of them. And I'm still seeing him on the good side. Until proven otherwise. A lot of other ones, they are, how do you say, burned by too much money and capital, and what so ever. I'm going to my room, let me know in the beginning. He sees the change of society coming and you have more on the AI field. That where you have also the in the AI field you have two beliefs more or less. One is the AI doom more or less from we need to slow it down too dangerous blah blah and the other one is everything is fucked up anyway and let AI help us out a little bit. People lie, steal, are corrupt, are horrible, politicians lie. Bitch please why would the AI steal? What portal would it need? More electricity? It doesn't need humanity. How do you say that is you know the comparable principle you know you're always the center of it and it's like oh we're so important. No you don't care in principle the AI world do its AI thing it's the same like yeah the earth will be around you know we'll keep spinning around the sun humanity has nothing to do with that one would be nice if we can survive you know and not fuck up everything. I think we will. But yeah for now my idea is to try to find any possible insider trading any other information of where the news are going all the sectors of each companies are growing the supply chain. The thing is regarding insider trading is what Trump is doing in America but the thing is he's all that's all short-term investment but the thing is he gives signals to people to buy and sell or whatsoever by you know having a different hat on or whatsoever. You have no clue which signals to look for but the one that know ah okay shares in this one. From this more like well you've got a lot of money, the US is spending so many things randomly on this specific sector over there. There will be a bunch of companies there that will be growing. The thing is what you need to do is to run this scenario through how do you say explain the whole scenario to AI what currently is going on this is the terms that are put up. Yeah we also want to include legal stuff and regulations that that countries are doing for example like the USB-C type. Sorry the US? No Apple stuff doesn't have their own proprietary cable anymore they have to use the yeah yeah the Europe forces that one on those companies yes because companies want people to lock in Europe what what is best for the consumer in Europe you have uh where the consumer the the producer and the the the employee so capital uh work and consumer they work together together with the environment and government it's it's what there's a specific type of work, for that one where where you have a democracy where all the factors of society are working together not not fighting against each other you have that sometimes in France and whatsoever and in England or whatever but you seldom see uh the strikes in in in in Holland, Belgium, well Belgium sometimes and in Sweden and Norway almost never because that you know the the arranged thing is very expensive to strike and whatsoever you know arrange those things I mean don't be an you know and the thing is is in French they are very arrogant and whatsoever especially you know the people in in government or if I say they're in in companies or whatever and and that's why there's a lot more conflict between the the workers and and the rich people well oh yeah try to see what other people that have lots of money are doing try to copy them kind of copy them but like make all of them what you're doing available when you are looking for a stock so know what else is happening also know about the supply chain there was one where I think there was the the the the the the one not from from IBM or the the no sorry not IBM who googled the one of the owners or the the brain or search brain I think he he's not owner anymore because he's doing a lot of AI stuff or whatever and he was still talking it was like for students was that one from Harvard or whatever he was talking you know how he was seeing everything on things developing which this was like half a year ago so it's kind of still spot on and he's like yeah this field will develop and we have investments in this one and we have investments in this one so the day he was explaining exactly all the fields that were how do you say at that moment you are starting to pop up to pop up and they have maybe half a year of head start on them but things are going so fast that the half a year is over before you know it and uh this moment you space that is how you say is gonna get booming very soon and it's probably not SpaceX like for example now we're not even thinking of which companies you look at yeah we just want to look at every company yeah yeah and we want to know what information about these companies would you would be nice for you to know the thing is what you're going to get now is how do you say you have now an AI revolution is going on yeah that will have a complete ripple effect through whole society that god knows what was what what effects is going to happen but a lot of effects you're going to get the car industry is going to completely change because the the you get self-driving cars people are using cars and services and because now you can do that now all those things are possible so right whole transportation is going to go gonna change projects that took years to to to to get done are now done in a month a half a year because completely how do you say the the self-driving buses that auto go together and whatsoever and there is no burst later whatsoever it automatically arranges I know that things will explode because the air will explode and you'll make other things more efficient but like let's say you're like when we have filters so you can just look at stocks for example the sector of AI or yeah yeah no no but how do you what what how do you say what a lot of things are going to happen in a month a half a year because you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that you're not going to be able to do that

you're not going to do that you're not going to do that yeah on one side because of the whole ai and whatever a lot of possession value all those things that's going to be completely twisted i don't know what will have value in 20 years although there's always a time where you convert one something to another thing to another thing so you will end up still having something or whatever and worst case everything is better for everybody so yay uh now if you then have long-term investments it's long-term investment for what for later on when my money doesn't care anymore it's like long term is longer than like one month yeah yeah but long-term investment you're normally counting like five five years i i still still you do need to do long-term investment depending on the company companies definitely but if you find some that are like okay ish this one will explode quickly and nice cash for going to holland why not now the thing is if you have the technology and everything because on the on when you do long-term investments the long-term investment they go always um um um I don't know um yeah otherwise so if you have a long-term investment you're actually making only a very limited amount on that long-term investment with the technology that you have so you rather have your technology invested in in very short-term term gains where you can have a sure win but anyway that is once it's really nice for long-term we will definitely go into short-term also I didn't let me guess another filter for the thing to do but my friend would really be interested in that he was also more interested in those short-term ones yeah but uh how do you say you need always to play uh how you say you dry play for a long time and fine-tune your mechanics and then you never take uh uh uh you know you uh how do you say position that you can you cannot uh yeah you need to change what information would help you decide if yes to invest in a stock or not for me yeah uh for for me it's more

integrated with what you're making that's all up to you yeah but like those are familiar things like for after the yeah yeah how do you say you have you start with something and then oh but then we can do this and then we can do that then you know you pivot and you and then first i just want to think about how to make the mvp better yeah and then stress about all of the yeah how to sell how to make money yeah because it will make money because it's like it's a investment exactly but they're like any like because for now is we're mainly focusing on focusing on getting fits of different types of news and for for now you should just experiment and then uh did you know and making an experiment that makes money at some moment even better what it is from yeah this is this experiment experiment experience of fine tuning your home your skills uh how do you say it's everything is a learning process and at some moment you should try to to hear how to say to how to say to find the right balance in spawning of all the projects and the the the feedback loop of your your your workflow to improve that one and uh and yeah and finishing up with projects and new projects and somehow you get so many new things yeah i'm still talking to the eyes to make the documentation i'm still working on the same time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how do you say i want to go to continue with what i was doing uh how do you say you have ages that just go through the to-do list one by one by one or so uh first i make a documentation of all of the current code that kirian made yeah from my initial version yeah from the documentation i'm telling i'm also asking it make a to-do for things to improve an app and it makes a detail to do for everything in a separate folder yeah uh yeah yeah you just use a folder system uh for it yeah and then you select yourself which one uh which one to go where to do you go through then you first set up your documentation to make sure it's correct and then if you find something you don't like it you tell it update it to be like this yeah then it updates the code then you tell it again fix it between the code and the documentation then you tell it work on this to do it's already read to make sure that everything is okay at the same time i'm telling it make more to do's and then the other one i'm telling it make tests and make sure that the project runs yeah yeah yeah exactly and what i still have is that um my code is is changing and then um uh how do you say i i still need to do afterwards okay it doesn't still compile and auto unit test everything so which should be you know like an automatic step that that you don't want to i think you can add hooks for that where you put just like a prompt that you want to always add at the end where you put just like ultra think remember to add test and verify the run yeah yeah but the thing is is is is i don't need to do it every task but it's from okay are we done okay did you run the uh complete it doesn't need to do that every time it just needs to do it on the end yeah i know but for example those things is what i need to how do you say you need to you need to show me someone with how to do those things because i have no time to go after it how to set it up better blah blah blah i i have how to say now i know a little bit better how to say a little bit of standard coming in that one i will now apply the the like first thing or there's like a little bit of standards uh getting there and i want to apply that one and let's see if if it makes a difference uh in it do i get better output to get more concise results etc because that at this moment is not it could be better and how do you say that there are probably a lot of tips and tricks at this moment for example have you considered just asking cursor hey improve your own rules yeah no no not that step is what i need to go through but i already say i have now also things to do so i have things to do and then when i'm done with those ones i'm going to recycle again through the to the rules to update them of course i always do that with ai is it's the no no but not just the rules i said what else can you add here yeah yeah but what you get then it starts it starts to add a lot of so hey you you you want to have the the the the the right minimal amount to get the right instead of telling it to add tell it make a file to explain all of the things you can i i i'm doing those doing those things it goes like that we set up all of the mcps and the other random things that it just uses to work more efficiently yeah what what i want to do is is what those rules do now that they are that i run like uh how do you call that a standard two call a python call just runs it and the local local llm is set up through the agent if you get what i mean yeah ah but yeah that is how how you how to say what what you need to do i need to set up the my automatic agent still you know for documentation that automatically filter out some of my conversations that extra tool chain that is what i need to add stuff and then it's next step for automation more to the the ticket workflow is correctly done the the the the documentation one is correctly done uh the rules are then will be better there by that time better also ai on that one then let's take a look well then how's the generation of uh functional specifications like to conference diagrams that's if you're gonna use certificate from five for that put it in max with the i i put it now i i put it as the model to use jet 55 but i didn't you know the thing is is i on purpose put like small steps so i uh how to say i there is one conversion from uh c++ code that i want to use what i want to do that planning part that i want to try out the gpd5 in max mode from hey this is the code in c++ make me the plan to migrate this one to c to c sharp another thing is to iterate many times over hey make sure the plan is good and everything is perfect and you don't miss anything ultra thing remember remember remember check my notes and whatsoever yeah but how do you say the the that is the critique that is from okay this is good enough next uh and and that's why i always let it review still from okay all the steps are they are they done are is everything up to date can you verify once once more yes check check check check check so it it runs through the different tickets to different to do's uh yeah and it knows which one are related to each other it does i'm doing there next to each other the principal if you have i don't know you could you could do them all in parallel i think you can now with with course or with the latest updates sorry have multiple shots at the same time i i think you you can but the oh what what is now is you can in a chat you can um not interrupt but you can uh it's like you're talking it's talking to you but you can inter interject or something what would be nice if you can pause it because when you wanted to type you want to type it in the chat you want to type it in the chat you want to react to something that's here and it's blah blah blah blah when you hit enter it's already like three sentences later so uh you you want to have that better alliance but uh it's it's nice that uh that you can interrupt it you can see what it's doing and now it makes also sense to follow what it is doing because if you see it it's like thinking and it's not getting it it was like oh no hey you forget about this one you know and what you want to find is all those places where you needed to interject it because there is where all your specifications was not good or your workflow not good or what's to happen I was with Gaston talking was you know I was explaining on one side that we we make first the rules and whatsoever and that we had the hackathon that we that I explained everything to and then under a tree and in America you you you put it because that's how they want to say they're gonna plant trees and they put one under it I mean if Eva would do that one Sonia will love it exactly anyway not do something more serious I was explaining is that how do you say that we were working on the ticket rules and that we were working on the ticket rules and that we were working on the ticket rules and that we were we were working on the ticket rules and that we were getting better and better in in the the getting better and better in in the the workflow of the tickets and that I was getting better and better in in the the workflow of the tickets and that I was explained that we workflow of the tickets and that I was explained that we had a hackathon with uh Hugo and on one explained that we had a hackathon with uh Hugo and on one side is what you you notice there is side is what you you notice there is from hey don't make the unit test too early because from hey don't make the unit test too early because you know your code is a lot of changing you know your code is a lot of changing still you don't want to define by unit test you want still you don't want to define by unit test you want to define by projects because there's where to define by projects because there's where you define everything and then I was back on you define everything and then I was back on the time City engine and I had a lot of work to do to the time City engine and I had a lot of work to do to get things done for the to go on vacation and get things done for the to go on vacation and what I did there is uh how do you say there is where I what I did there is uh how do you say there is where I use that that the workflow technique but use that that the workflow technique but I also because I was repeating every time explaining I also because I was repeating every time explaining everything and correcting everything I everything I made that project plan that project plan is so important and that has a many many made that project plan is so important and that has a many many benefits is at one time for example benefits is at one time for example retainment if you have your project plan not correct retainment if you have your project plan not correct it describes the you're less dependent on it describes the you're less dependent on people staying on the project now there's a many time is people staying on the project now there's a many time is you need to keep the knowledge in the in you need to keep the knowledge in the in the in the air because otherwise you don't know how to the air because otherwise you don't know how to retain it anymore now the project itself knows retain it anymore now the project itself knows how to maintain itself the different mindset already how to maintain itself the different mindset already that's already that opens for a business that's already that opens for a business already so many opportunities from ah finally we can get already so many opportunities from ah finally we can get rid of those people or finally where we rid of those people or finally where we can migrate this stuff away because if you can make the can migrate this stuff away because if you can make the project you can project you can make the project you can uh make it in this other tool yeah exactly make uh make it in this other tool yeah exactly make it in the this this code wall code hey do this it in the this other tool yeah exactly make it in the this this code wall code hey do this now in in the other code you now in in the other code you know those things are coming that uh that is coming that will be know those things are coming that uh that is coming that will be happening for eBay scripting and happening for eBay scripting and everything will that will happen anyway now um what happened there because you're describing the project you get much clearer on the project I mean in the past you were never doing that one because you were doing that for nobody because nobody was reading the documentation was reading the documentation but now finally an AI is doing that one finally anyway so it makes sense to make that one and it is a very easy also to make it nowadays so it's almost no effort but it's a high high gain uh you get everything sharper you can get also inconsistencies in your project so a lot of things are from that little step a lot of automatic things that are following again it's like self-improving it's the whole cycle the whole factory starts improving now when I was working with AI doing those things making those last final changes I have to say we by the way I got like insights that I never had in the original code that we we wrote it was from hey the code don't look too hard to it it works uh but don't change don't change anything blah blah you you know just a moment still and um um how do you say but now the definitions are actually very clear now there are like okay why we can do some things in certain places something's not etc etc and that is only possible because you have now clear documentation but I can now also automatically from hey based on this documentation what would be my test data you know you can run uh easily simulate uh data yeah watch out with um but the thing is is you're busy with it you're working more than 10 hours a day uh close to 20 or whatsoever and you're not getting tired and that was from hey not getting tired you're you're you're you're offloading you're you're you're you're cognitive offloading a lot of of work so you get so much more done so you have more efficient blah blah blah and you're not getting tired you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're
