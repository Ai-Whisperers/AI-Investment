# AI-Driven Development Platform

## Concept Overview
Create a comprehensive AI-driven development environment that transforms the entire software development lifecycle, reducing time from idea to production by 90% while maintaining industry-standard quality.

## Vision
"An automated development environment which goes as fast as possible from ID to final product with really fast cycle times."

            'reviewer': ReviewerAgent(),
            'tester': TesterAgent(),
            'deployer': DeployerAgent()
        }
    
    def process_idea(self, idea):
        # 1. Architecture design
        design = self.agents['architect'].design(idea)
        
        # 2. Implementation
        code = self.agents['developer'].implement(design)
        
        # 3. Review and refinement
        reviewed_code = self.agents['reviewer'].review(code)
        
        # 4. Testing
        tests = self.agents['tester'].create_tests(reviewed_code)
        
        # 5. Deployment
        result = self.agents['deployer'].deploy(reviewed_code, tests)
        
        return result
