# Redis Caching Implementation

## Concept Overview
Implement Redis as a high-performance caching layer to reduce database load and improve response times.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Repeated database queries for same data
- Slow response times for complex calculations
- High database load during peak usage
- Redundant API calls to external services
- Limited concurrent user capacity

### Impact
- User experience degradation
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Scalability limitations
- API rate limit consumption

## Solution Architecture

### Cache Layers

#### Level 1: Session Cache
- User authentication tokens
- User preferences
- Active session data
- Temporary calculations

#### Level 2: Application Cache
- Market data (1-5 minute TTL)
- Portfolio calculations
- Strategy results
- API responses

#### Level 3: Shared Cache
- Reference data
- Historical prices
- Market indicators
- Static content

## Implementation Strategy

### Data Categories

#### High-Frequency Cache (TTL: 1-5 minutes)
- Current prices
- Portfolio values
- Real-time metrics
- Active calculations

#### Medium-Frequency Cache (TTL: 5-60 minutes)
- Historical data
- Market statistics
- Benchmark data
- Aggregated metrics

#### Low-Frequency Cache (TTL: 1-24 hours)
- User profiles
- Asset metadata
- Strategy configurations
- Reference data

### Cache Patterns

#### Cache-Aside Pattern
- Check cache first
- Load from source if miss
- Update cache with result
- Return data

#### Write-Through Pattern
- Write to cache and database
- Ensures consistency
- Higher write latency
- Good for critical data

#### Write-Behind Pattern
- Write to cache immediately
- Async database update
- Better performance
- Risk of data loss

## Technical Implementation

### Redis Configuration

#### Deployment Options
- Redis Cloud (managed)
- AWS ElastiCache
- Self-hosted Redis
- Redis Sentinel (HA)
- Redis Cluster (scaling)

#### Memory Management
- Eviction policies (LRU)
- Memory limits
- Key expiration
- Persistence options

### Data Structures

#### Strings
- Simple key-value pairs
- JSON serialization
- Binary data
- Counters

#### Hashes
- User profiles
- Portfolio data
- Configuration objects
- Session data

#### Lists
- Price history
- Transaction logs
- Event queues
- Activity feeds

#### Sets
- User portfolios
- Asset collections
- Tag systems
- Unique values

#### Sorted Sets
- Leaderboards
- Time-series data
- Ranking systems
- Priority queues

## Caching Strategy

### Cache Invalidation

#### Time-Based
- TTL expiration
- Scheduled refresh
- Sliding windows
- Absolute expiry

#### Event-Based
- Data updates
- User actions
- Market events
- System triggers

#### Manual
- Admin controls
- Cache flush
- Selective invalidation
- Debugging tools

### Cache Warming

#### Startup Warming
- Preload common data
- Initialize calculations
- Populate reference data
- Build indexes

#### Predictive Warming
- User behavior patterns
- Time-based predictions
- Popular data sets
- Trending queries
