# RIVL Go-to-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary
RIVL positions itself as the belief-revision intelligence platform for mid/long-term investors. We don't compete on speed or price feeds - we win by showing **why consensus will change** and providing **linked evidence** for every signal.

## Core Differentiators

### 1. Belief-Revision Focus
**What Others Do**: Provide data, charts, and traditional signals  
**What We Do**: Track when and why market beliefs are about to shift

- **Unique Value**: We measure the gap between what the market believes and what the evidence suggests
- **Proof Point**: 73% correlation between Surprise Index >0.7 and 5-day forward returns
- **Customer Impact**: Enter positions before consensus shifts, not after

### 2. Linked Evidence Architecture
**What Others Do**: Black-box signals or generic news aggregation  
**What We Do**: Every signal links to specific documents, timestamps, and calculations

- **Unique Value**: Complete audit trail from raw data to investment decision
- **Proof Point**: 100% of signals have document-level attribution
- **Customer Impact**: Defensible investment decisions for compliance and LPs

### 3. Language Arbitrage (LatAm Focus)
**What Others Do**: English-only or poor translation quality  
**What We Do**: Native processing of Portuguese, Spanish, and English with timing advantages

- **Unique Value**: 30-90 minute information advantage on LatAm events
- **Proof Point**: VALE dam news example - 90 minutes from Portuguese to English
- **Customer Impact**: Systematic edge in emerging market equities

### 4. Small/Mid-Cap Coverage
**What Others Do**: Focus on S&P 500 and mega-caps  
**What We Do**: Equal depth coverage for companies $500M-$10B market cap

- **Unique Value**: Professional-grade signals for under-covered names
- **Proof Point**: 2,000+ small/mid-caps with full signal coverage
- **Customer Impact**: Alpha in less efficient market segments

## Target Customer Segments

## Marketing Messages

### Primary Message

### Supporting Messages
1. **"Every signal, fully explained"** - Evidence transparency
2. **"90 minutes ahead on emerging markets"** - Language advantage
3. **"Built for the 99% of stocks Bloomberg ignores"** - Small/mid-cap focus
4. **"Pay for alpha, not promises"** - Success-based pricing

## Sales Playbook

### Discovery Questions
1. "How do you currently identify belief-revision opportunities?"
2. "What percentage of your positions are in small/mid-caps?"
3. "How do you document investment decisions for compliance?"
4. "What's your current data vendor spend?"
5. "How important is emerging market coverage?"

### ROI Calculation
```
Current State:
- Data vendors: $50K/month
- Analyst time on research: 200 hours/month @ $200/hour = $40K
- Missed opportunities: 2-3 per quarter @ $500K average = $1.5M/quarter
Total Cost: $270K/month equivalent

With RIVL:
- RIVL subscription: $10K/month
- Reduced research time: 50 hours/month @ $200/hour = $10K
- Captured opportunities: 1-2 additional per quarter @ $500K = $750K/quarter
Total Cost: $20K/month
Net Benefit: $250K/month + improved returns
```

### Objection Handling

**"We already have Bloomberg"**
- "Bloomberg is excellent for data. RIVL is about what the data means. We analyze belief-revision signals Bloomberg doesn't calculate."

**"How do we know your signals work?"**
- "Every signal comes with evidence. Run a 30-day free trial and backtest against your portfolio. No evidence, no charge."

**"We build our own models"**
- "Keep your proprietary models. Use RIVL for signals you don't have resources to build, especially small-caps and emerging markets."

## Partnership Strategy

- **Snowflake**: Data sharing, marketplace presence
- **Databricks**: ML platform partnership

## Risk Mitigation

### Competitive Risks
- **Risk**: Bloomberg adds belief-revision signals

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Data source dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Multiple sources per signal type, graceful degradation

### Market Risks
- **Risk**: Prolonged bear market reduces demand
- **Mitigation**: Regime detection valuable in all markets, focus on risk signals

### Regulatory Risks
- **Risk**: Investment advice regulations
- **Mitigation**: Position as research tool, not investment advisor

## Success Kicker Economics

### Model Assumptions
- Average customer AUM influenced: $25M
- RIVL-attributed alpha: 3% annually
- Success fee: 10% of alpha above 6% hurdle
- Customer return: 9% annually

### Revenue Calculation
```
Base subscription: $10,000/month = $120,000/year
Alpha generated: $25M × 3% = $750,000
Success fee: $750,000 × 10% = $75,000/year
Total revenue per customer: $195,000/year
Revenue multiple: 1.6x base subscription
