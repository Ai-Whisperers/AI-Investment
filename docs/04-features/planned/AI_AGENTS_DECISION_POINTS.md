# AI Agents System - Key Decision Points & Questions

##  Critical Decisions Required Before Development

### 1. Infrastructure & Deployment

#### Cloud Provider Selection
**Question**: Which cloud provider should we use for the AI agents infrastructure?

**Options**:
- **AWS** 
  - Pros: Mature ecosystem, SageMaker for ML, extensive services
  - Cons: Complex pricing, steeper learning curve
  - Cost estimate: $3,500-4,000/month

- **Google Cloud Platform**
  - Pros: Best ML/AI tools, Vertex AI, BigQuery for analytics
  - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less documentation
  - Cost estimate: $3,200-3,700/month

- **Azure**
  - Pros: Enterprise integration, Azure ML, good for Windows stack
  - Cons: UI complexity, occasional service issues
  - Cost estimate: $3,400-3,900/month

- **Hybrid/Multi-cloud**
  - Pros: Best of each platform, avoid vendor lock-in
  - Cons: Complex management, higher operational overhead
  - Cost estimate: $3,800-4,500/month

**Recommendation**: GCP for AI/ML capabilities or AWS for ecosystem maturity

### 2. Transcription Service

#### Whisper Deployment Strategy
**Question**: Should we use OpenAI's Whisper API or self-host Whisper models?

**Options**:
- **OpenAI Whisper API**
  - Cost: ~$0.006/minute ($500/month for 100 hours)
  - Pros: No infrastructure, automatic updates, reliable
  - Cons: API dependency, data privacy concerns, ongoing costs

- **Self-hosted Whisper**
  - Cost: GPU instance ~$1,200/month
  - Pros: Data privacy, no API limits, customizable
  - Cons: Infrastructure management, GPU costs, maintenance

- **Hybrid Approach**
  - Use API for peak loads, self-host for baseline
  - Balance cost and reliability

**Recommendation**: Start with API, migrate to self-hosted at scale

### 3. Vector Database Selection

#### Embeddings Storage Solution
**Question**: Which vector database for storing and searching embeddings?

**Options**:
- **Pinecone** (Managed)
  - Cost: $70-500/month based on usage
  - Pros: Fully managed, excellent performance, easy scaling
  - Cons: Vendor lock-in, costs scale with data

- **Weaviate** (Self-hosted/Cloud)
  - Cost: $0 self-hosted, $500+ cloud
  - Pros: Open source, GraphQL API, hybrid search
  - Cons: Operational overhead if self-hosted

- **Qdrant**
  - Cost: $0 self-hosted, $250+ cloud
  - Pros: Fast, efficient memory usage, good filtering
  - Cons: Smaller community, less mature

- **PostgreSQL + pgvector**
  - Cost: Included in existing PostgreSQL
  - Pros: No new infrastructure, SQL interface
  - Cons: Less optimized for vector search at scale

**Recommendation**: Start with pgvector, migrate to Pinecone/Weaviate at scale

### 4. Message Queue Architecture

#### Streaming Platform Choice
**Question**: Should we use Apache Kafka or alternatives for event streaming?

**Options**:
- **Apache Kafka** (Self-managed)
  - Pros: Industry standard, high throughput, proven at scale
  - Cons: Complex operations, requires expertise
  - Cost: ~$300/month infrastructure

- **Confluent Cloud** (Managed Kafka)
  - Pros: Fully managed, enterprise features
  - Cons: Expensive at scale
  - Cost: $500-2000/month

- **Redis Streams**
  - Pros: Simpler, already in stack, good for moderate scale
  - Cons: Not as feature-rich as Kafka
  - Cost: Included in Redis cluster

- **AWS Kinesis / GCP Pub/Sub**
  - Pros: Fully managed, cloud-native
  - Cons: Vendor lock-in
  - Cost: $200-800/month

**Recommendation**: Redis Streams initially, Kafka for production scale

**Question**: How should we deploy and orchestrate MCP servers?

**Options**:
- **Kubernetes Pods**
  - Each MCP server as a separate deployment
  - Auto-scaling based on load
  - Service mesh for communication

- **Serverless Functions**
  - AWS Lambda / GCP Cloud Functions
  - Pay-per-execution model
  - Automatic scaling

- **Container Instances**
  - AWS ECS / GCP Cloud Run
  - Middle ground between K8s and serverless

**Recommendation**: Kubernetes for control and flexibility

##  Important Technical Decisions

### 6. Data Retention Policy

**Question**: How long should we retain different types of data?

**Suggested Policy**:
```yaml
Raw Data:
  Social posts: 30 days
  Transcripts: 90 days
  Videos: 7 days (if stored)

Processed Data:
  Embeddings: Indefinite
  Sentiment scores: 1 year
  Insights: 2 years

User Data:
  Activity logs: 90 days
  Preferences: Indefinite
  Deleted data: 30 days (soft delete)
```

### 7. API Rate Limiting Strategy

**Question**: How do we handle platform API rate limits?

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Distributed Rate Limiting**
   - Redis-based token bucket
   - Per-platform queues
   - Automatic backoff

2. **Multiple API Keys**
   - Rotate between keys
   - Different keys for different operations

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache duration based on data type
   - Invalidation rules
