##  Whisper Cost Analysis

### Option Comparison:
| Option | Cost | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|------|----------------|
| OpenAI API | $30-50/mo | No infrastructure, reliable | Per-minute cost |  **Use for MVP** |
| Self-hosted | $1,200/mo | Unlimited usage | GPU costs, maintenance | Use at scale only |

**Decision**: Use OpenAI Whisper API
- $0.006/minute = $0.36/hour
- Budget $30/month = 83 hours transcription
- Strategy: Only transcribe high-value content (>10k views)

## ️ Architecture Changes

### From Complex to Simple:
```yaml
Before:
  - Kubernetes orchestration
  - Apache Kafka streaming  
  - Multiple databases
  - Dedicated GPU clusters
  - Complex microservices

After:
  - Azure Functions (serverless)
  - Azure Service Bus (free tier)
  - Single PostgreSQL (existing)
  - API-based AI services
  - Simple event-driven
```

##  Technology Stack (Final)

### Infrastructure
- **Compute**: Azure Functions (serverless)
- **Workflow**: n8n on Azure Container Instance
- **Queue**: Azure Service Bus (free tier)
- **Cache**: Azure Cache for Redis (free tier)
- **Database**: Render PostgreSQL (existing)

### AI Services
- **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper API
- **Analysis**: GPT-4 (existing subscription)
- **Advanced**: Claude (existing subscription)

### Data Sources
- **Reddit**: Official API (free tier)
- **YouTube**: Data API v3 (free tier)
- **TikTok**: Web scraping with proxy ($20)

##  Scalability Path

```yaml
Current (MVP):
  Users: 100
  Cost: $100/month
  Revenue: $0

3 Months:
  Users: 500
  Cost: $150/month
  Revenue: $1,000/month (100 × $9.99)
  
6 Months:
  Users: 2,000
  Cost: $300/month
  Revenue: $5,000/month (200 × $9.99, 50 × $49.99)

12 Months:
  Users: 10,000
  Cost: $1,000/month
  Revenue: $20,000/month
  
At this point: Consider original architecture
```

## ️ Legal Compliance Solution

### Monthly Review System (Automated)
```python
# Runs as Azure Function Timer Trigger
- Check Terms of Service changes
- Verify API compliance
- Monitor scraping policies  
- Generate compliance report
- Email alerts if issues detected

Cost: $0 (included in Azure Functions)
```

### Risk Levels
- **YouTube**:  Low (official API)
- **Reddit**:  Low (official API)
- **TikTok**: ️ Medium (web scraping)

##  Quick Start Actions

### Week 1 (Immediate)
1. Create Azure free account ($200 credit)
2. Set up Reddit API credentials
3. Deploy first Azure Function
4. Install n8n container
5. Test end-to-end pipeline

### Week 2
