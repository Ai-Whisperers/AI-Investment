## 🔴 CRITICAL (MVP Blockers)

### 1. Configure API Keys 📝
**Priority**: HIGHEST | **Time**: 30 minutes | **Status**: User Responsibility

**IMPORTANT**: API keys are configured directly in the Render.com dashboard, NOT in code.
Navigate to your Render service → Environment → Add these keys:

- [ ] `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` - Get from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
- [ ] `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` - Same as above
- [ ] `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` - Get from Google Cloud Console
- [ ] `MARKETAUX_API_KEY` - Get from https://www.marketaux.com
- [ ] `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY` - Get from https://twelvedata.com
- [ ] `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` - Create in Discord server settings
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - For OAuth, from Google Console
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Same as above
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, for AI chatbot enhancement

**Note**: System works without API keys but with limited functionality.

### 2. Deploy to Production 🚀
**Priority**: HIGH | **Time**: 1 hour | **Status**: Ready

Steps:
