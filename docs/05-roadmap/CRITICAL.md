# Critical TODOs üî¥

[‚Üê Back to TODO](README.md)

## 0. URGENT: Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation
**Impact**: Financial data integrity, regulatory compliance, production stability
**Coverage Target**: 95%+ (Financial industry standard)
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks

### Why This Is Now Priority #0
- **Financial Risk**: Untested portfolio calculations could cause significant financial losses
- **Regulatory**: Financial systems require auditable testing for compliance
- **Current Coverage**: ~25% is unacceptable for production financial systems
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests BEFORE fixing other critical issues

### Core Testing Requirements
```yaml
Coverage Requirements:
  - Portfolio Calculations: 100% (CRITICAL)
  - Risk Models: 100% (CRITICAL)
  - Performance Metrics: 100% (CRITICAL)
  - API Endpoints: 95%+
  - Frontend Components: 90%+
  - Integration: 95%+
```

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Set up test infrastructure (pytest-cov, React Testing Library, Playwright)
- [ ] Write unit tests for ALL financial calculations
- [ ] Implement contract testing between frontend/backend
- [ ] Create E2E tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Add performance tests (100k events/sec requirement)
- [ ] Configure CI/CD with coverage gates

### Test Categories
1. **Fast Tests** (< 1s each)
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Component tests without API calls
   - Mocked external services

2. **Slow Tests** (> 1s each)
   - Integration tests with database
   - Real Celery task tests
   - E2E browser tests

### Blocking Issues Until Complete
- ‚ùå Cannot migrate calculations without tests
- ‚ùå Cannot deploy to production without 95% coverage
- ‚ùå Cannot guarantee data integrity without test suite

**See detailed specification**: [Testing Strategy](../../03-implementation/backend/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

## 1. Code Structure Refactoring (Pre-Testing Requirement)
**Impact**: Testing becomes impossible with god files, violates clean architecture
**Priority**: MUST complete before comprehensive testing
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE (20% done - 4 of 20 files refactored)

### Frontend Structure Issues
- [x] ‚úÖ **Dashboard God File** (797 ‚Üí 173 lines): `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - **COMPLETED**
  - Extracted: DashboardMetrics, PortfolioChart, AllocationChart, ChartControls, SimulationPanel
  - Created hooks: useDashboardData, useSimulation, useChartControls
  - Added DashboardProvider for context management

- [x] ‚úÖ **PerformanceChart Component** (547 ‚Üí 281 lines): **COMPLETED**
  - Extracted: ChartTooltip, ChartControlsPanel, AssetSelector
  - Created utilities: chartConfig, chartDataProcessor
  - Modularized into PerformanceChart/ directory structure

- [x] ‚úÖ **Diagnostics Page** (524 ‚Üí 90 lines): **COMPLETED**
  - Extracted: SystemSummaryCard, DatabaseStatusCard, CacheStatusCard, RefreshStatusCard
  - Created hook: useDiagnosticsData for state management

- [ ] **StrategyConfig Component** (488 lines): Multiple responsibilities
  - Split into smaller strategy components
  - Extract validation logic
  - Move calculations to domain layer

### Backend Structure Issues  
- [x] ‚úÖ **Strategy Service** (633 ‚Üí 284 lines): `app/services/strategy.py` - **COMPLETED**
  - Extracted: DataValidator, WeightCalculator, RiskCalculator, PortfolioOptimizer
  - Created modular strategy/ directory with single-responsibility modules

- [ ] **News Service** (564 lines): Too many responsibilities
  - Extract sentiment analysis
  - Separate entity extraction
  - Move aggregation logic

- [ ] **TwelveData Service** (535 lines): Mixed provider and service logic
  - Separate API client from business logic
  - Extract data transformation
  - Move caching logic to decorator

- [ ] **TwelveData Provider** (513 lines): Duplicate implementation
  - Consolidate with service refactoring

- [ ] **Performance Service** (498 lines): Mixed calculations
  - Extract return calculations
  - Separate risk metrics
  - Split benchmark comparison

- [ ] **Diagnostics Router** (444 lines): Too many endpoints
  - Split into health, metrics, and status routers
  - Extract diagnostic services
  - Separate concerns

- [ ] **Background Tasks** (370 lines): All task types in one file
  - Split into task-specific modules

- [ ] **MarketAux Provider** (357 lines): Mixed concerns
  - Extract API client from processing logic

### Clean Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Frontend: Complete migration to core/ clean architecture pattern
  - Move remaining business logic from components to use cases
  - Ensure all API calls go through repositories
  - Separate presentation from domain logic

- [ ] Backend: Implement proper layering
  - Create domain layer with business entities
  - Implement repository pattern for data access
  - Use dependency injection consistently
  - Separate infrastructure from business logic

### Benefits After Refactoring
- ‚úÖ Each file under 250 lines (testable size)
- ‚úÖ Single responsibility per module
- ‚úÖ 95%+ test coverage becomes achievable
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and extend
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns

## 2. Frontend Calculations Migration
**Impact**: Performance, scalability, data consistency
**Location**: `apps/web/app/lib/calculations/`
**Effort**: 2-3 days

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify all calculation functions in frontend
- [ ] Create corresponding backend endpoints
- [ ] Migrate calculation logic to Python
- [ ] Update frontend to use API calls
- [ ] Test calculation accuracy
- [ ] Remove frontend calculation code

### Affected Files
- `apps/web/app/lib/calculations/portfolio.ts`
- `apps/web/app/lib/calculations/performance.ts`
- `apps/web/app/lib/calculations/risk.ts`
