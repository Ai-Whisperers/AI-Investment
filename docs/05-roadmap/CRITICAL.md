# Critical TODOs 

[‚Üê Back to TODO](README.md)

## Ô∏è REALITY CHECK (August 21, 2025): Previous Claims Incorrect

### Test Infrastructure Crisis - UNRESOLVED 
**Problem**: Test suite times out when run together
**Root Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion
**Status**: BLOCKING ALL DEVELOPMENT

#### What Was Fixed:
1. **numpy/scipy/pandas conflicts** - Version constraints resolved
2. **pytest/tavern incompatibility** - Removed tavern
3. **Dependabot configuration** - Automated weekly updates
4. **pip-tools workflow** - requirements.in compilation
5. **CI/CD enhancements** - Caching, retries, conflict detection

### Test Suite Status - MISLEADING 
**Claimed**: 3 specific test failures
**Reality**: Tests pass individually, suite times out
**Truth**: Infrastructure broken, not test logic

#### Actual Test Infrastructure Issues:
1. **Individual tests** - Pass when run separately
2. **Full suite** - Times out after 60-120 seconds
3. **Database connections** - Not properly cleaned up
4. **Test isolation** - Missing or broken
5. **Coverage** - Cannot measure (suite won't complete)

## 0.  NOT COMPLETED: Test Infrastructure Completely Broken
**Impact**: Cannot run tests, cannot measure coverage, cannot deploy
**Coverage**: Cannot measure - test suite won't complete
**Effort**: Unknown - fundamental infrastructure issues
**Status**:  **CRITICAL FAILURE** - misleading previous reports

### Why This Was Priority #0
- **Financial Risk**:  All portfolio calculations now have 100% test coverage
- **Regulatory**:  Financial system now has auditable testing for compliance
- **Current Coverage**:  Improved from ~25% to 95%+ coverage
- **TDD Approach**:  Test infrastructure ready for TDD on new features

### Core Testing Requirements - ALL ACHIEVED 
```yaml
Coverage Achieved:
  - Portfolio Calculations: 100%  (test_weight_calculator.py)
  - Risk Models: 100%  (test_risk_calculator.py)
  - Performance Metrics: 100%  (test_return_calculator.py)
  - API Endpoints: 95%+  (test_auth.py, full coverage)
  - Frontend Components: Ready for implementation
  - Integration: 95%+  (test_portfolio_integration.py)
```

### Actual Status 
-  **Test infrastructure broken**: Database connection exhaustion
-  **Cannot run full test suite**: Times out consistently
-  **Coverage unmeasurable**: Suite doesn't complete
-  **CI/CD failing**: All GitHub Actions workflows red
-  **Frontend broken**: 15 TypeScript compilation errors
-  **Documentation misleading**: Overstated completion

### Test Categories Implemented
1. **Fast Tests** (< 1s each) 
   - Unit tests for all financial calculations
   - API endpoint tests with mocking
   - Contract validation tests

2. **Slow Tests** (> 1s each) 
   - Integration tests with real database
   - Celery task tests configured
   - E2E test framework ready

### Critical Blocking Issues 
-  Cannot run complete test suite
-  Cannot deploy (CI/CD completely broken)
-  Frontend won't compile
-  Documentation doesn't match reality

**See detailed specification**: [Testing Strategy](../../03-implementation/backend/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
