# Roadmap & Priority Management

## REAL Priority Levels (Updated 2025-08-21)

### 🔴 [URGENT FIXES](URGENT-FIXES.md) - BLOCKING EVERYTHING
Critical infrastructure failures that must be fixed first
- ❌ Test suite timeout (database connection exhaustion)
- ❌ Frontend TypeScript errors (15 compilation failures)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline broken (all workflows failing)
- ❌ Documentation was misleading (now corrected)

### 🔥 [AI AGENT FEATURES](../04-features/planned/AI_AGENTS_INDEX.md) - HIGH VALUE
Extreme alpha generation through social signal processing
- 🤖 4chan/Reddit/TikTok/YouTube scraping agents
- 📊 Pattern recognition for 6-48hr early detection
- 💰 Target >30% annual returns
- 📈 Information asymmetry exploitation

### 🟡 [CRITICAL](CRITICAL.md) - After Infrastructure Fixed
Core features needed for basic operation
- Database migration system
- API optimizations
- Performance improvements

### 🟢 [HIGH PRIORITY](HIGH_PRIORITY.md) - Enhanced Features
Important improvements after basics work
- Admin endpoints
- Rate limiting
- WebSocket updates

### 🔵 [PROJECT ROADMAP](PROJECT-ROADMAP.md) - Long-term Vision
Strategic planning and timeline
- Q1: Fix infrastructure + deploy
- Q2: Build AI agents
- Q3: Scale and monetize
- Q4: Institutional features

## Real Stats (Updated 2025-08-21)

| Priority | Issue | Status | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 🔴 URGENT | Test suite timeout | BLOCKING | Cannot test |
| 🔴 URGENT | Frontend errors | 15 errors | Cannot build |
| 🔴 URGENT | CI/CD broken | All failing | Cannot deploy |
| 🔥 HIGH | AI Agents | Planned | >30% returns |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Basic features | Partial | Standard ops |

**Reality Check**: Previous claims of 97.6% test pass rate were misleading - tests timeout

## Current Focus

| Task | Reality | Action Required |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Fix test infrastructure | Database connections broken | Debug connection pool |
| Fix frontend build | 15 TypeScript errors | Fix imports and types |
| Restore CI/CD | All workflows failing | Fix GitHub Actions |
| Document reality | Was misleading | ✅ Now corrected |

## What Was Claimed vs Reality

### FALSE Claims (Now Corrected)
- ❌ "97.6% test pass rate" - Tests actually timeout
- ❌ "CI/CD pipeline fixed" - All workflows failing
- ❌ "Frontend calculations migrated" - Frontend won't compile
- ❌ "Production ready" - Multiple critical blockers

### TRUE Status
- ✅ Documentation now reflects actual state
- ✅ AI agent vision preserved as high priority
- ✅ Basic features exist but blocked by infrastructure
- ✅ Render.com deployment configured but can't deploy

## Actually Blocked Items ⚠️
- Everything blocked by test infrastructure
- Frontend blocked by TypeScript errors
- Deployment blocked by CI/CD failures
- AI agents blocked until basic platform works
