# Roadmap & Priority Management

## REAL Priority Levels (Updated 2025-08-21)

###  [URGENT FIXES](URGENT-FIXES.md) - BLOCKING EVERYTHING
Critical infrastructure failures that must be fixed first
-  Test suite timeout (database connection exhaustion)
-  Frontend TypeScript errors (15 compilation failures)
-  CI/CD pipeline broken (all workflows failing)
-  Documentation was misleading (now corrected)

###  [AI AGENT FEATURES](../04-features/planned/AI_AGENTS_INDEX.md) - HIGH VALUE
Extreme alpha generation through social signal processing
-  4chan/Reddit/TikTok/YouTube scraping agents
-  Pattern recognition for 6-48hr early detection
-  Target >30% annual returns
-  Information asymmetry exploitation

###  [CRITICAL](CRITICAL.md) - After Infrastructure Fixed
Core features needed for basic operation
- Database migration system
- API optimizations
- Performance improvements

###  [HIGH PRIORITY](HIGH_PRIORITY.md) - Enhanced Features
Important improvements after basics work
- Admin endpoints
- Rate limiting
- WebSocket updates

###  [PROJECT ROADMAP](PROJECT-ROADMAP.md) - Long-term Vision
Strategic planning and timeline
- Q1: Fix infrastructure + deploy
- Q2: Build AI agents
- Q3: Scale and monetize
- Q4: Institutional features

## Real Stats (Updated 2025-08-21)

| Priority | Issue | Status | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
|  URGENT | Test suite timeout | BLOCKING | Cannot test |
|  URGENT | Frontend errors | 15 errors | Cannot build |
|  URGENT | CI/CD broken | All failing | Cannot deploy |
|  HIGH | AI Agents | Planned | >30% returns |
|  MEDIUM | Basic features | Partial | Standard ops |

**Reality Check**: Previous claims of 97.6% test pass rate were misleading - tests timeout

## 🎯 Current Sprint Focus (Week of Jan 25)

| Task | Time | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Configure API Keys | 30 mins | 🔴 Do Now |
| Deploy to Render | 1 hour | 🔴 Today |
| Run Migrations | 5 mins | 🔴 After Deploy |
| Enable Workflows | 10 mins | 🟡 Tomorrow |
| Test Production | 1 hour | 🟡 Tomorrow |
