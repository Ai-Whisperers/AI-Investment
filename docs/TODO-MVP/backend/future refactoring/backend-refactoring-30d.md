- [ ] **Missing database migrations** - No Alembic setup for schema versioning
- [ ] **Missing composite indexes** - Need (asset_id, date) for time-series queries
- [ ] **No database partitioning** - Will struggle with large time-series data
- [ ] **Missing audit fields** - No created_at, updated_at, deleted_at tracking
- [ ] **No archival strategy** - Old data not archived

#### 2. **API Design Issues**
- [ ] **Inconsistent error handling** - No centralized error management
- [ ] **No request/response validation middleware** - Limited to basic Pydantic
- [ ] **Incomplete API versioning** - Basic v1 prefix but no versioning strategy
- [ ] **No rate limiting** - Vulnerable to DoS attacks
- [ ] **Lack of request correlation IDs** - Difficult debugging
- [ ] **Incomplete API documentation** - Missing OpenAPI examples

#### 3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- [ ] **CORS configuration issues** - Allows all origins (["*"]) in development
- [ ] **No additional input sanitization** - Only basic Pydantic validation
- [ ] **Weak authentication** - Simple JWT without refresh tokens
- [ ] **No authorization layers** - All authenticated users have same permissions
- [ ] **Missing security headers** - No CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
- [ ] **No audit logging** - Cannot track user actions
- [ ] **No API key authentication** - Only JWT available

#### 4. **Performance Issues**
- [ ] **N+1 query problems** - Visible in refresh service loops
- [ ] **No caching layer** - Repeated expensive calculations
- [ ] **Synchronous external API calls** - Blocking TwelveData requests
- [ ] **Large object serialization** - Full datasets without pagination
- [ ] **No background task queue** - Long operations block responses
- [ ] **Missing query optimization** - No EXPLAIN plan analysis
- [ ] **No bulk operations optimization** - Individual inserts in loops

#### 5. **Service Layer Problems**
- [ ] **Tight coupling** - Services directly access database models
- [ ] **Mixed responsibilities** - Business logic scattered across layers
- [ ] **No dependency injection** - Hard to test and mock dependencies
- [ ] **No circuit breaker pattern** - External API failures cascade
- [ ] **Missing retry mechanisms** - No resilience for transient failures
- [ ] **No service interfaces** - Concrete implementations only

### Code Quality Issues

#### 1. **Type Annotations**
- [ ] **Inconsistent typing** - Some functions lack proper type hints
- [ ] **Mixed return types** - Functions return different types conditionally
- [ ] **No validation of external API responses** - TwelveData response not validated
- [ ] **Missing domain models** - Using database models for business logic

#### 2. **Error Handling**
- [ ] **Generic exception handling** - Catching all exceptions without specifics
- [ ] **No error context** - Logs don't include debugging information
- [ ] **Inconsistent error responses** - Different formats across endpoints
- [ ] **Missing error boundaries** - Errors propagate without handling

#### 3. **Testing**
- [ ] **No unit tests** - Critical business logic untested
- [ ] **No integration tests** - API endpoints not validated
- [ ] **No database testing** - Migration and schema changes untested
- [ ] **No performance testing** - No benchmarks for critical operations
- [ ] **No API contract testing** - No validation of OpenAPI specs

#### 4. **Monitoring & Observability**
- [ ] **Inconsistent logging levels** - Debug info mixed with errors
- [ ] **No structured logging** - Difficult to parse and analyze
- [ ] **Missing business metrics** - No tracking of portfolio performance
- [ ] **No health metrics** - Only basic health check endpoint
- [ ] **No distributed tracing** - Cannot track requests across services

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss**: Current refresh service deletes all data
2. **Security**: Multiple vulnerabilities in authentication/authorization
3. **Performance**: No optimization for scale
4. **Reliability**: No resilience patterns implemented

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement comprehensive testing before deployment
2. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. Set up monitoring before refactoring
4. Create rollback procedures
5. Document all changes thoroughly

## Notes

- Priority should be given to data loss prevention and security fixes
- Performance optimizations can be implemented gradually
- Testing infrastructure should be built in parallel with refactoring
- Consider using feature flags for safe deployment of changes
- All database schema changes must be backward compatible
