## üöß In Progress

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test database models initialization with new modular structure
- [ ] Validate all API endpoints with new imports
- [ ] Performance testing of optimized refresh service

## üìã To Do

### High Priority
- [ ] **Complete Migration to New Structure**
  - [ ] Update all direct imports from `..models` to `..models.*`
  - [ ] Update all direct imports from `..schemas` to `..schemas.*`

  - [ ] Update all type hints to use new imports

- [ ] **API Enhancements**
  - [ ] Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
  - [ ] Implement request/response caching
  - [ ] Add API versioning support

- [ ] **Data Quality & Validation**
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation
  - [ ] Add data consistency checks
  - [ ] Create data migration scripts for schema changes
  - [ ] Add database backup/restore functionality

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Implement database query optimization
  - [ ] Add database connection pooling configuration
  - [ ] Optimize bulk operations with batch processing
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for large datasets

- [ ] **Monitoring & Observability**
  - [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs
  - [ ] Implement health check endpoints
  - [ ] Add performance metrics collection
  - [ ] Create alerting rules for critical errors

- [ ] **Security Enhancements**
  - [ ] Implement API key authentication as alternative to JWT
  - [ ] Add request signing for sensitive operations
  - [ ] Implement audit logging for all operations
  - [ ] Add input sanitization middleware

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Generate OpenAPI documentation
  - [ ] Create API usage examples
  - [ ] Document error codes and responses
  - [ ] Create deployment guide

- [ ] **Developer Experience**
  - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality

  - [ ] Add automated API testing suite
  - [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline improvements

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Twelve Data API Integration**
   - Occasional timeout issues during market hours
   - Need to implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Consider caching frequently requested data

2. **Database Performance**
   - Slow queries for historical data aggregation
   - Need to add appropriate indexes
   - Consider partitioning large tables

3. **Memory Usage**
   - High memory consumption during bulk refresh operations
   - Need to implement streaming for large datasets
   - Add memory profiling

## üí° Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Integration**
  - Implement predictive analytics for index performance
  - Add anomaly detection for unusual market conditions
  - Create recommendation engine for portfolio optimization

- **Multi-Strategy Support**
  - Allow multiple strategies per user
  - Implement strategy backtesting framework
  - Add strategy performance comparison

- **Advanced Risk Management**
  - Implement Value at Risk (VaR) calculations
  - Add stress testing capabilities
  - Create risk dashboards with alerts

## üìù Notes

- All new features should follow the established modular architecture
- Ensure backward compatibility when making changes
- Add comprehensive tests for all new functionality
- Update documentation for any API changes
- Consider performance implications for all changes
