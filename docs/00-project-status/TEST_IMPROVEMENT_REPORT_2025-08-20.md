6. **Weight Calculator Tests** (14/17 passing - 82%)
   - Fixed equal weight calculations for 3 assets
   - Updated constraint application logic
   - Fixed dict/Series compatibility
   - 3 momentum strategy tests still failing (feature incomplete)

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. **Best Practices Applied**
- Used `pytest.approx()` for floating-point comparisons
- Added proper error tolerances (rel=1e-4, abs=1e-10)
- Fixed timezone-aware datetime handling
- Improved test isolation and independence

### 2. **Clean Architecture Principles**
- Maintained separation of concerns
- Followed SOLID principles
- Used dependency injection patterns
- Applied factory patterns for test data

### 3. **Technical Debt Addressed**
- Fixed deprecated datetime.utcnow() warnings
- Updated for Pydantic v2 compatibility
- Resolved numpy/scipy version conflicts
- Fixed pandas frequency string deprecations

## Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. **Skipped Tests** (2 tests)
- **Admin Endpoints**: Not yet implemented
  - Location: `test_auth.py::test_admin_endpoint_access`
  - Impact: Low - admin features not required for MVP
  
- **Rate Limiting**: Middleware not implemented
  - Location: `test_auth.py::test_rate_limiting`
  - Impact: Medium - should be added before production

### 2. **Failing Tests** (3 tests)
- **Momentum Strategy**: Implementation incomplete
  - Location: `test_weight_calculator.py::test_momentum_*`
  - Impact: Low - other strategies working correctly
  - Solution: Complete momentum calculation algorithm
