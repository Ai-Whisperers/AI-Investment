# URGENT FIXES REQUIRED - Action Items

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Before Production Deployment)

### 1. Clean Architecture Violations
**Files**: `apps/api/app/routers/analysis.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/auth.py`
**Issue**: Domain logic and database access in presentation layer
**Impact**: Violates Clean Architecture, makes testing impossible, tight coupling
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

### 2. OAuth Security Vulnerability  
**File**: `apps/api/app/routers/auth.py:149-174`
**Issue**: CSRF vulnerability - state validation uses client-side cookies
**Impact**: Security breach potential
**Timeline**: 2-3 days

### 3. Monolithic Service Classes
**File**: `apps/api/app/services/investment_engine.py` (735 lines)
**Issue**: Single class violating Single Responsibility Principle
**Impact**: Unmaintainable, untestable, hard to extend
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

## âš¡ HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Within Month)

### 4. Database Performance Issues
**File**: `apps/api/app/services/strategy.py:105-109`
**Issue**: N+1 query patterns causing performance degradation
**Timeline**: 1 week

### 5. Missing Admin Authentication
**File**: `apps/api/app/routers/websocket.py:285`
**Issue**: Admin endpoints with TODO comments, no authentication
**Timeline**: 3-5 days

## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

1. **Week 1**: Fix OAuth security vulnerability (2-3 days)
2. **Week 1**: Add missing admin authentication (2-3 days)  
3. **Week 2-3**: Implement repository pattern to remove direct DB access
4. **Week 3-4**: Extract domain logic from routers to services
5. **Week 4-5**: Fix N+1 query performance issues
6. **Week 6-8**: Break down monolithic investment engine

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] No business logic in router files
- [ ] No direct database queries in presentation layer
- [ ] OAuth state managed server-side
- [ ] All admin endpoints properly authenticated
- [ ] Database queries optimized (no N+1 patterns)
- [ ] Investment engine split into focused classes

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT vs TARGET STATE

| Aspect | Current State | Target State |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Architecture | Mixed concerns | Clean separation |
| Security | CSRF vulnerable | Server-side state |
| Performance | N+1 queries | Optimized queries |
| Maintainability | 735-line classes | <200 line focused classes |
| Testing | 45% coverage | 80%+ coverage |

**Priority**: URGENT - Required before production deployment  
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 weeks total  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Architecture and security issues
