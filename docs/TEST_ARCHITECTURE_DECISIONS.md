# Test Architecture Decisions
## Modular Testing Strategy - Avoiding God Objects

Generated: 2025-01-20

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the testing architecture decisions made for the Waardhaven AutoIndex project. The primary goal is to maintain modularity and avoid god objects in both production code and tests.

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility in Tests
Each test file focuses on testing ONE component/module/function. We avoid creating massive test files that test everything.

** Good Example:**
```
tests/unit/services/test_return_calculator.py  # Only tests ReturnCalculator
tests/unit/services/test_risk_calculator.py    # Only tests RiskCalculator
```

** Bad Example:**
```
tests/test_everything.py  # God test file testing all services
```

### 2. Modular Test Factories
Instead of one giant factory class, we created focused factories with single responsibilities:

```
tests/factories/
├── base.py           # Base utilities only
├── user_factory.py   # User-related data only
├── asset_factory.py  # Asset/price data only
├── portfolio_factory.py  # Portfolio data only
└── strategy_factory.py   # Strategy configs only
```

Each factory:
- Has a single, clear purpose
- Can be used independently
- Doesn't depend on other factories
- Generates only its domain data

### 3. Test Helpers and Adapters
Created separate helper modules to handle specific concerns:

```
tests/helpers/
├── adapters.py     # Data type conversions
└── assertions.py   # Custom assertions for financial data
```

**Purpose**: Keep test logic clean by extracting common patterns without creating monolithic utilities.

## Backend Testing Architecture

### Structure
```
apps/api/tests/
├── conftest.py           # Minimal shared fixtures
├── factories/            # Modular data generators
│   ├── base.py
│   ├── user_factory.py
│   ├── asset_factory.py
│   ├── portfolio_factory.py
│   └── strategy_factory.py
├── helpers/              # Test utilities
│   ├── adapters.py
│   └── assertions.py
├── unit/                 # Unit tests by module

│   │   └── test_weight_calculator.py
│   └── routers/
│       └── test_auth.py
├── integration/          # Integration tests
├── contract/            # API contract tests
└── smoke/               # Production smoke tests
```

### Key Decisions

#### 1. Factory Pattern over Fixtures
**Decision**: Use factory classes instead of massive fixture files.

**Rationale**:
- Factories are composable
- Each factory has single responsibility
- Easier to maintain and understand
- Avoid fixture dependency hell

**Example**:
```python
# Instead of giant fixture
@pytest.fixture
def complete_test_data():  # God fixture
    # 500 lines of data setup
    pass

# We use focused factories
user = UserFactory.create_user_data()
portfolio = PortfolioFactory.create_portfolio_data()
```

#### 2. Test Adapters for Type Mismatches
**Decision**: Create adapters instead of modifying business logic for tests.

**Rationale**:
- Business logic remains pure
- Tests adapt to implementation, not vice versa
- Clear separation of concerns

**Example**:
```python
# Adapter converts test data to implementation format
class TestDataAdapter:
    @staticmethod
    def dict_to_series(data: Dict) -> pd.Series:
        return pd.Series(data)
```

#### 3. Separate Test Categories
**Decision**: Organize tests by testing strategy, not just by module.

**Categories**:
- **Unit**: Fast, isolated, no dependencies
- **Integration**: Test module interactions
- **Contract**: API contract validation
- **Smoke**: Critical path validation
- **Performance**: Benchmark tests

## Frontend Testing Architecture

### Structure
```
apps/web/app/__tests__/
├── utils/               # Test utilities
│   ├── test-utils.tsx   # Render helpers
│   ├── mock-data.ts     # Mock data generators
│   └── mock-api.ts      # API mocking
├── components/          # Component tests
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── DashboardMetrics.test.tsx
├── hooks/              # Hook tests
│   └── useAuth.test.tsx
└── services/           # Service tests
    └── api/
        └── diagnostics.test.ts
```

### Key Decisions

#### 1. Custom Render Function
**Decision**: Create a thin wrapper around React Testing Library.

**Rationale**:
- Provides common providers without bloat
- Each test can customize as needed
- Avoids provider god object

```typescript
export function renderWithProviders(ui, options?) {
  // Minimal wrapper with only necessary providers
}
```

#### 2. Separated Mock Data
**Decision**: Split mock data by domain, not by test.

**Files**:
- `mock-data.ts`: Domain objects
- `mock-api.ts`: API responses
- Component-specific mocks in test files

**Rationale**:
- Reusable across tests
- Easy to maintain
- Clear data ownership

#### 3. Focused Component Tests
**Decision**: Each component test file tests ONE component.

**Structure**:
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('Rendering', () => {})
  describe('User Interactions', () => {})
  describe('State Management', () => {})
  describe('Error Handling', () => {})
})
```

## Testing Anti-Patterns We Avoid

### 1. God Test Files
**Anti-pattern**: One test file testing multiple unrelated components.

**Our Approach**: One test file per component/module.

### 2. God Fixtures
**Anti-pattern**: Massive fixtures with complex dependencies.

**Our Approach**: Small, focused factories that compose.

### 3. Test-Driven Implementation
**Anti-pattern**: Modifying business logic to make tests pass.

**Our Approach**: Use adapters and helpers to bridge gaps.

### 4. Monolithic Test Utilities
**Anti-pattern**: One utility file with hundreds of helper functions.

**Our Approach**: Focused utility modules with single responsibilities.

### 5. Deeply Nested Describes
**Anti-pattern**: 
```javascript
describe('Component', () => {
  describe('when logged in', () => {
    describe('with data', () => {
      describe('on click', () => {
        // 5 levels deep!
      })}})})
```

**Our Approach**: Maximum 3 levels of nesting.

## Coverage Strategy

### Backend Coverage Targets
```yaml
Critical Paths:
  Financial Calculations: 100%  # Regulatory requirement
  API Endpoints: 95%
  Business Logic: 90%
  Utilities: 80%
  
Overall Target: 95%
```

### Frontend Coverage Targets
```yaml
Components:
  Business Logic: 90%
  UI Components: 80%
  Hooks: 90%
  Services: 85%
  
Overall Target: 80%
```

### Coverage Principles
1. **Quality over Quantity**: Better to have fewer, meaningful tests
2. **Critical Path First**: Focus on business-critical functionality
3. **Incremental Improvement**: Start with low targets, increase gradually
4. **No Coverage Gaming**: Avoid meaningless tests for coverage

## Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development
```bash
# Backend
cd apps/api
pytest tests/unit -v        # Fast feedback
pytest tests/integration    # Before commit

# Frontend
cd apps/web
npm test                    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage check
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
stages:
  - fast_tests:     # Unit tests (<30s)
  - slow_tests:     # Integration tests
  - contract_tests: # API contracts
  - smoke_tests:    # Critical paths only
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. **Check existing patterns** first
2. **Use existing factories** when possible
3. **Create new factory** only if domain doesn't exist
4. **Keep tests focused** on single responsibility
5. **Document complex logic** in tests

### Refactoring Tests
1. **Extract common patterns** to helpers
2. **Avoid deep coupling** between tests
3. **Maintain independence** - tests should run in any order
4. **Update factories** when domain changes

### Test Review Checklist
- [ ] Does the test have a single, clear purpose?
- [ ] Are we using existing factories/helpers?
- [ ] Is the test independent of others?
- [ ] Does it avoid testing implementation details?
- [ ] Is the assertion meaningful?
- [ ] Would this test catch real bugs?
